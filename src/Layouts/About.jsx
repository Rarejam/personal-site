          Hi, Iâ€™m Jamaldeen AgaraðŸ‘‹ a computer science student with a passion
          for web development, game development, 3D animation, and fitness.
          Currently serving in the U.S Army Reserves as a CBRN specialist, I use
          disciplined and detail-oriented methods in my work. In my free time, I
          like exploring new technologies. With an OSHA 10-Hour General Industry
          certification, I prioritize safety and maintain professionalism in all
          environments.
